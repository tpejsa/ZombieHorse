ZombieHorse is an animation system and testbed written in C++.

OBTAINING AND COMPILING THE SYSTEM

Source code of the system can be obtained from the following public repository:

	https://github.com/tpejsa/ZombieHorse
	
The system can be compiled using Visual Studio 2010 or later. The solution file ZombieHorse.sln can be found in the repository root.

The following external libraries and SDKs are required to compile and use the software:
	
	boost
	wxWidgets (2.8 or later)
	OGRE SDK (1.8 or later)

HOME variables must be defined for all libraries and set to their root directories (BOOST_HOME, WXWIDGETS_HOME, and OGRE_HOME).

Once the software is compiled, you can try out the animation testbed by running bin\release\AnimationStudio.exe. The testbed application will automatically load any BVH motions found in samples\data\animations.
